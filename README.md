# Vaadin Valo Styles

## ⚠️ This repository is deprecated

This repository, and the previous `vaadin-valo-theme` Bower package, will be removed after March 2018.

“Valo” has been renamed to “Lumo”. Please migrate to the [`vaadin-lumo-styles`](http://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles) package instead, which is just a rename of this repo – the content is the same.

**You can ignore this deprecation warning** if you do not have an explicit dependency to this package in your `bower.json` – the deprecation message will go away once you update all [Vaadin elements](https://vaadin.com/elements) to versions that have migrated to using `vaadin-lumo-styles`.


## Why a new repository, why not rename this repository?

By having another repo, it should be a little less disrupting to anyone using this package at the moment, since the new package version number will start from `1.0` and not from `2.0` as in this package.
